      "contents": "\r\nA Retrospective Two-Stage Analysis of COVID Cases by County\r\nObjective: The COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. has exhibited a distinct multiwave pattern beginning in March 2020. Paradoxically, most counties do not exhibit this same multiwave pattern. We aim to answer three research questions: (1) How many distinct clusters of counties exhibit similar COVID-19 patterns in the time-series of daily confirmed cases?; (2) What is the geographic distribution of the counties within each cluster? and (3) Are county-level demographic, socioeconomic and political variables associated with the COVID-19 case patterns?\r\nMethods: We analyzed data from counties in the U.S. from March 1, 2020 to January 2, 2021. Time series clustering identified clusters in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. An explanatory model was used to identify demographic, socioeconomic and political variables associated with the outbreak patterns.\r\nResults: Three patterns were identified from the cluster solution including counties in which cases are still increasing, those that peaked in the late fall, and those with low case counts to date. Several county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and political variables showed significant associations with the identified clusters.\r\nImplications: Some work on why other people should care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Other Project\r\nObjective: Repeat styling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
