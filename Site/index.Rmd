# Welcome to my Site

Welcome to my personal site! I am an aspiring data analyst. I enjoy solving real-world problems, combining my background in R and my training in business analytics. I am also passionate about learning new skills, reproducible research, and sharing my lessons learned with other data scientists. Check out my most recent projects in my Portfolio tab.
