**Comment:** You have been hearing about **big data** in SPC for over a decade now. For example, my paper titled [Statistical Perspectives on Big Data](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ab40f392e653b7336cbebf7c4fb95d3988748282) was published almost exactly 10 years ago in the ISQC Workshop in Sydney. We now have models that can digest and generate answers based on more than 45TB of text.

# Background: Generative AI

]

.font90[
-  The generated content is based on a .bold[.red[stochastic behavior embedded in generative AI models such that the same input prompts results in different content]].
- State-of-the-art generative AI models can have up to **540 billion parameters** ([PaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311)).  
- With the increase in model size, researchers have observed the **“emergent abilities”** of LLMs, which were **not explicitly encoded in the training**. [Examples include](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/characterizing-emergent-phenomena-in.html):
  + Multi-step arithmetic,   
  + taking college-level exams, and 
  + identifying the intended meaning of a word.  
- LLMs are **foundation models** (see [Bommasani et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)), large pre-trained AI systems
that can be **repurposed with minimal effort across numerous domains and diverse tasks.**

## Ferris: How is Generative AI transforming the way you teach?

.font80[
🌐 **More Open and Collaborative Assessment** 🌐  

- 🤖 Every student now has a *personal tutor* at their fingertips, ready to answer most questions in **mere seconds**. Let's embrace this change, not resist it!   
- 🚀 I'm excited to announce that I'll soon be integrating assessments that encourage the use of GenAI as a coach.  Tools like [ChatISA](https://chatisa.fsb.miamioh.edu/)) are revolutionizing how students approach programming assignments and debug them, saving valuable contact time.    

🎨 **Diverse and Dynamic Assessments** 🎨

💡 With the power of *GenAI*, we can swiftly prototype innovative question types and offer a diverse range of questions, ensuring a comprehensive assessment experience!

## Ferris: The Future of AI

.font80[
💼 **Boosting Daily Productivity** 💼

- 🚀 Imagine a day where GenAI takes care of mundane tasks, gifting you more time and freedom. This isn't just about **efficiency** —it's about unleashing your **innovation** and **creativity** to the fullest!    

🔍 **Revolutionizing Data Access** 🔍

- 💡 If costs can come down (reduced compute power or new hardware), a true revolution in how we **access and search data** could be on the horizon.   
  + 📑 Think of the *United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)* and how much work it requires to verify a new application against their catalog.

📉 **A Predicted Downturn... but a Bright Future Ahead!** 📈

- ⚠️ I see some bumps on the GenAI road. Concerns around data privacy, the environment, and upcoming legislation may cause a brief regression in AI capabilities and availability.  

- 🌟 Once this turbulence passes, I foresee more advanced models capable of multiple tasks vs the current single focus models (we are somewhat seeing this currently with plugins mostly).

🧠 **Mastering Modern Tools** 🧠  

- 💡 It's crucial for students to develop the skill of harnessing such tools
effectively for problem-solving.  

⚖️ **Accuracy & Validation** ⚖️  

- ❗ Responses from ChatGPT may occasionally contain **inaccuracies**, such as erroneous code or incorrect facts. Therefore, it’s imperative to **educate students on the importance of cross-validating the
information** they receive from ChatGPT to ensure its reliability.

🔍 **Search Capabilities** 🔍

- Evolves as a new type of search engine.  
- Superior summarization capabilities.  
- **Limitation:** May not have the most up-to-date information.  
- Cannot discern reliability of reference sources.

📊 **Data Collection and Analysis** 📊

- The co-pilot feature simplifies coding, though it's not flawless.    
- Increases efficiency in descriptive analysis.  
- **Limitation:** Not suitable for handling confidential data under current settings.

🖋️ **Content Generation** 🖋️ 

- Aids in refining writing, especially beneficial for non-native English speakers.
- Assists in exploring new research directions.
- Helps articulate complex arguments.

## Shan: The Future of AI

.font80[
🚀 **Predicted Innovation in the Age of GAI** 🚀

- The integration of GAI will be as ubiquitous in the modern business landscape as personal computers, Windows OS, and iPhones once were.  
- It's imperative for higher education to adapt to this changing landscape, equipping students to harness the full potential of GAI.
- However, just as WiFi access once did, the high costs associated with GAI could exacerbate digital inequality.

💡 **Empowering the Everyday Learner** 💡 

- GAI will serve as a catalyst for personal learning, transforming average learners into exceptional ones.  - It holds the potential to address and rectify the most significant challenges facing online education and MOOCs.

🔮 **ChatGPT-7 and Beyond:** 🔮

- Personal AI profiles will offer tailored experiences, but this customization will bring forth privacy challenges.  
- As organic data emerges as the new battlefield, we may witness a shift towards more restrictive data
ecosystems. The ideal of a free and open internet may be at stake.  
- Copyright issues will pave the way for a burgeoning industry focused on green, or ethical, content generation.
