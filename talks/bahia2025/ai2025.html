## The Fear of Technological Unemployment is Not New

&gt; "The **fear** has even been expressed by some that **technological change** would in the **near future not only cause increasing unemployment**, but that **eventually it would eliminate all but a few jobs**, with the major portion of what we now call **work being performed automatically** ..."

???
We have the honor to present the report of the National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress. This Commission was established by Public Law 88-444, which was approved by Congress on August 5, 1964, and signed by the President on August 19, 1964.

The Commission was appointed by the President in December 1964, and the
appointments were approved by the Senate on January 27, 1965.

## Historical Predictions of Technlogical Change

&gt; .black[.bold[Technological change]] on the other hand, has been a .black[.bold[major factor]] in the **displacement and temporary unemployment of particular workers**. Thus technological change (along with other forms of economic change) is an important determinant of the **precise places, industries, and people affected by unemployment**.

## My Opinion on the Integration of GenAI in Courses


.font70[
There is no singular recipe for integrating GenAI in courses. The integration of GenAI in courses should be based on the **course objectives**, **learning outcomes**, and **assessment methods**. 

I believe that the **integration of GenAI in courses** can be simplified into dimensions: **(a) Learning Activities** and **(b) Assessment Activities**, with AI being .black[.bold[prohibited]] or .black[.bold[controlled/integrated/encouraged]] within each dimension.  

]

.font70[

  |   | **AI Not Permitted**  | **AI Permitted (Controlled/Integrated)**  |
    |---|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | **Learning Activities**   | **Prohibited in Learning** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Rationale:** &lt;br&gt;• Fosters independent learning &lt;br&gt;• Allow for broader discussion on: &lt;br&gt; - *AI Ethics*, and &lt;br&gt; - *Environmental stewardship* &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Examples:** &lt;br&gt;• No AI for drafting &lt;br&gt;• No AI for brainstorming or feedback | **Integrated in Learning** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Rationale:** &lt;br&gt;• Advances *technological literacy*, &lt;br&gt;• Stimulates *creative thinking*, &lt;br&gt;• Stimulates *analytical thinking*, and &lt;br&gt;• Supports *lifelong learning* &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Examples:** &lt;br&gt;• AI-assisted brainstorming and drafting &lt;br&gt;• Personalized feedback via AI tools |
    | **Assessment Activities** |  | **Integrated in Learning and Assessment** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Rationale:** &lt;br&gt;• Supports coherent skill development when AI is integrated in learning  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Examples:** &lt;br&gt;• AI-assisted assessments/exams with clear guidelines |

## The Cost-Benefit Analysis of AI in Learning

.font70[

|   | **Benefits of AI in Learning** | **Risks of AI in Learning** |
|---|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Summary** | AI offers enhanced productivity, synthesis, and alignment with modern workplace tools. | AI introduces potential for misinformation and diminished learner autonomy. |
| **Key Points** | • Can replace traditional search tasks &lt;br&gt;• Synthesizes and summarizes content &lt;br&gt;• Generates creative outputs quickly &lt;br&gt;• Becoming a core workplace skill | • Prone to hallucinations (false but confident answers) &lt;br&gt;• May erode student agency and critical thinking &lt;br&gt;• Encourages over-reliance on automation &lt;br&gt;• Quality depends heavily on prompting and oversight |
| **Tension** | Encourages innovation and tech literacy | Raises ethical, epistemic, and educational concerns |

]


### 🎯 My Goal in This Talk

To share how I attempt to **walk this tight line:** recognizing that while AI can genuinely support learning and creativity, it must be used **critically and intentionally** to avoid undermining deeper educational values.

???

This framing sets the tone: you're not here to argue for or against AI outright — you're here to show your nuanced, practical approach as an educator working in real classrooms with real constraints.

## Evaluating AI-Generated Responses in ISA 401 (Q6F24)

I have asked ChatGPT to critique the .black[.bold[third chart]] in [this Financial Times article](https://www.ft.com/content/392e1e79-a8c1-4473-ab51-3267c415b078) (a static image of is presented below).

## Evaluating AI-Generated Responses in ISA 401 (Q6F24)

.font70[
.black[.bold[ChatGPT presented a lot of "potential" issues with the chart. It was a ton to put on an exam question, so I followed up with, "Forget about that; how do I ask relevant data visualization questions to data visualization business students based on this chart?"]]  It mentioned several things including:

&gt; Here are some data visualization questions that could help business students critically analyze and interpret this chart:  
&gt;
&gt; **1. Interpretation and Context:**  
&gt; - What additional context or baseline data would help make the shifts in support more meaningful for viewers?  
&gt; - How would you ensure the chart communicates both the change in support and the initial levels of support in 2020?  
&gt;
&gt; **2. Design Choices:**  
&gt; - Why might the designer have chosen arrows to represent shifts? Are arrows the most effective way to communicate this information?
&gt; - How could alternative chart types (like a .black[.bold[bar chart]] or slope chart) change the audience’s interpretation of these shifts?
 

So I naturally asked the following question based on the underlined content from ChatGPT answer above, "Can you make a bar chart with this data to allow students to compare?" **It made the chart in the next slide (assume that the values in it are correct since ChatGPT likely eye-balled the values from the Financial Times Chart).**

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="" data-start="1254" data-end="1414"&gt;
        &lt;p class="" data-start="1256" data-end="1414"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1256" data-end="1273"&gt;Holt&amp;rsquo;s Method&lt;/strong&gt; accounts for trend, so even though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly model seasonality, it's still far superior to methods that ignore the trend entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="" data-start="1415" data-end="1484"&gt;
        &lt;p class="" data-start="1417" data-end="1484"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1417" data-end="1435"&gt;Seasonal Naive&lt;/strong&gt; works better when strong seasonality is present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="" data-start="1485" data-end="1618"&gt;
        &lt;p class="" data-start="1487" data-end="1618"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1487" data-end="1514"&gt;12-Month Window Average&lt;/strong&gt; adapts slightly better than a global historical average by capturing local trend and seasonal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1625" data-end="1640"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1643" data-end="1675"&gt;Option A. Historical Average&lt;/strong&gt; will have the &lt;strong data-start="1690" data-end="1703"&gt;worst MAE&lt;/strong&gt; because it fails to account for both the &lt;strong data-start="1745" data-end="1761"&gt;upward trend&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="1766" data-end="1787"&gt;seasonal patterns&lt;/strong&gt; evident in the time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="" data-start="162" data-end="165" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of the ChatGPT interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (You do not need to look at the recording; I am just providing you to emphasize that I did not try to trick ChatGPT in any of my exam questions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.loom.com/share/19a10e510c3c4471b02a654230b2b6b0?sid=81642c49-6e9c-4bad-8ba6-6221f48cce50" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;my video recording of the interaction&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the ChatGPT project only contains the course notes for context and I did not provide it with any custom instructions besides what is in the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="" data-start="162" data-end="165" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exam Question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess the &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;correctness&lt;/span&gt; of (a) &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;ChatGPT's answer&lt;/span&gt; and (b) &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;its justification&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;If there are error(s) in either the answer or justification, please present each error in its bullet point&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In this question, ChatGPT was able to provide a **correct answer**, but it **did not provide a correct justification**. Additionally, some students struggle with these types of assessment questions.

# Concluding Remarks

---


## AI is Here to Stay, ...  

- But educators should have the **academic freedom** and **pedagogical autonomy** to decide how to use AI in their courses (from prohibiting it to encouraging its use).   

- I would be happy to share my experiences and insights on using AI in my courses, and learn from your experiences as well.  

- I am also happy to share our **ChatISA** app with you, and I encourage you to experiment with it.

## Happy to Answer any Questions
