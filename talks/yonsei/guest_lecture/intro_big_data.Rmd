# Big Data: The Three Vs

# Big Data: Beyond the 3 Vs

- The term big data refers not only to the size or **volume** of data, but also to the **variety** of data and the **velocity** or speed of data accrual.

- Other **V’s** important to big data problems are:  
  + **Veracity:** Trustworthiness of the data  
  + **Value:** Added value to creating knowledge in a topic  

- Both veracity and value relate to *data quality*

```{r ap_hack, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}

.pull-right[

- The tweet caused the U.S. Dow Jones Index to drop momentarily by 140 points.

# Some Practical Advice for Big Data Analytics

- **Question the `r emo::ji("question")`** Are you answering a question worth answering? **Before you start:** Attempt to quantify the return on investment (ROI) on the best possible case (perfect model).   
- **Correct** `r emo::ji("check")` data, i.e.,   
    + *Do you actually capture the important predictors?*  
    + *Is your data aggregated to the right level?*  
- **Cleaned** `r emo::ji("bath")` data, i.e.,   
    + *Is your data worth analyzing?*   
- **Iterate** ""Fail early, fail often, but always fail forward", **prior to deployment**. Also have time-points, where you can `r emo::ji("stop")` the project if need to.

# Big Data Technologies (What to Focus On?)

I do not argue against learning the basics behind specific technologies (e.g.,  using the excellent [MMDS book](http://www.mmds.org/) as a starting reference), but as a business student, I would argue you should first focus on how to **ask important questions, assess data and solution needs, etc.**

Some **Disclaimers:**

- Technology is constantly changing and you will be expected to continue to learn and grow in your career.  
- Hype and trendy topics change (e.g., [Gartner's new outlook on big data](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-05-19-gartner-says-70-percent-of-organizations-will-shift-their-focus-from-big-to-small-and-wide-data-by-2025) is quite different from their 2010-2015 messaging), but the core problem remains the same, how to leverage internal and external data to drive value `r emo::ji("bag")` for your organization.

# Manufacturing 4.0: A Big Data Example 

- **Goal:** Detect manufacturing defects in 3D printing (additive manufacturing) in near rear-time.  

- **Sensor Choice:** A thermal camera to detect anomalies in the cooling patterns for each-built layer.  

- **Approach:** An image monitoring of the resulting thermal camera images.  

- **Payoff:** Reduction of scrapped and wasted materials, improved **real** utilization of the 3d printers.

**Video Source:** How thermal cameras can be used to detect layer-by-layer additive manufacturing defects. Video combines work done at Auburn, with online thermal camera illustrations. Note that we use this illustration to highlight the use case of image monitoring for additive manufacturing, without exposing any real data from industrial partners.

# Trucking 4.0

- **Goal:** Examine whether driver-recorded safety critical events can be predicted (with a future 30-minute window used to allow for rest-break scheduling).  

- **Sensor Choice:** A smart breaking system.  

- **Approach:** A supervised machine learning approach was utilized to predict the occurrence (yes/no) of a safety critical event in the next 30-minute window, with features capturing *weather*, *mapping* APIs and *driver's* trip history.  

- **Payoff:** Minimizing crash risk (which is beneficial from a human safety perspective as well as a monetary perspective to the trucking company).

- The occurrence of **safety critical events can be predicted in 30-minute intervals**.

-  Developed machine learning models are **generalizable to new drivers** and do **not require frequent training**.

- **Improved safety outcomes can be achieved** by deploying our models as a part of existing routing and rest-break scheduling models.

# A Game to Evaluate your Understanding

To assess your understanding and retention of the topics covered today, you will **compete in a Kahoot game/competition (consisting of 5 questions)**:  

- Go to <https://kahoot.it/>  

- Enter the game pin, which will be shown during class

- Provide your first (preferred) and last name

- Answer each question within the allocated 20-second window (**fast and correct answers provide more points**)

<br>

**Winning the competition involves having as many correct answers as possible AND taking the shortest duration to answer these questions.** The winner `r fontawesome::fa(name = 'trophy', fill = 'gold')` of the competition will receive a FC Cincinnati souvenir. Good luck!!!

**P.S:** The Kahoot competition will have **no impact on your grade**. It is a **fun** way of assessing your knowledge, motivating you to ask questions about topics covered that you do not have a full understanding of it, and providing me with some data that I can use to pace today's class.
