# Preface: Similarities between of US and Korea

Two **major goals** for this talk are to: (a) highlight some of my research methods, outcomes, and experiences, and (b) develop ideas for future collaborations given some of the similarities that I noticed between both the US and Korea (from economic and research perspectives).

# Preface: Data $\neq$ Knowledge

  - **2011:** “**More information ought to be useful, but only if companies can interpret it**. And workers are already overloaded: **62%** of them say that the quality of what they do is **hampered because they cannot make sense of the data they already have …**” [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2011/12/31/too-much-buzz)
- **2022:**   ``**Eight out of 10 global workers are suffering from information overload**''  
  + ``Of those surveyed in the U.S., **76%** felt that information overload contributes to their **daily stress**. Another **35%** percent said this overload is having a **detrimental effect on their work performance, with 30% revealing it is affecting their overall job satisfaction** ...

## End-to-End Ergonomic Risk Assessment for Operator 5.0

.center[.bold[Research Questions]]

.font80[

1. How can we automatically divide the time series of acceleration signals, obtained from a wrist-worn accelerometer, into different segments? 

2. Within each segment, can we determine the correct task label for the segment?  

3. How accurately can we determine the total duration of each identified/performed task?  

4. How accurately can we determine the number of repetitions for repetitive tasks, such as the number of lifts or the number of hand pulls in a hoisting task.

5. How can we fuse the physical ergonomic risk factors (i.e., task type, duration, repetition) from the sensor with load and task-design information to systematically estimate the probability of a workplace injury?

# Improving Heart Transplant Prediction

### United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)

- The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is a nonprofit association that manages the U.S. organ transplantation system and database.  

- Our UNOS dataset contained 129 predictors (43 numeric and 86 categorical) and 45,005 observations.  
  + The imbalance ratio in the response variable is ~ 6.29 (where 1-year graft survival = 38,829 & failure = 6,176 cases)

# COVID-19 Deaths in 3,108 U.S. Counties

.pull-left[

- Using a multinomial regression model, we were able to:  

  + Identify some of the **explanatory factors** that can be used to explain a **county's assignment to a given cluster**.  
  
  + Our **overall accuracy was about 61.25%**, which is statistically significant when compared to the baseline of 25% (random prediction of the four classes).

# Seat Assignment with Social Distancing

.content-box-grey[
.center[.bold[Research Motivation]]
.font90[
- In the U.S., school districts created strict layouts for student bus seating depending on the **bus configuration** and **social distancing** requirements (6ft $\rightarrow$ 3.3 ft). See [KY Guidelines Archived](https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED611894/page/6/mode/2up).  

- However, these guidelines did not account for the fact that often students from the same household ride together in the same school bus.

# $D^3$ Requires a Team

.pull-left[
- $D^3$ requires a **team** 

- **Meaningful data-driven research** should be:    
  + Application-based (“business”)  
  + Driven by grand challenges 
  + Impactful (i.e. actionable)  
  
- I would be excited to collaborate with **Yonsei faculty** on problems such as the ones I presented today
