<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Reading and Cleaning the Data Export from Academ</h1>
<p>To prepare the exported data from Academ for analysis, we carried out a series of cleaning and restructuring steps to ensure consistency and make the dataset ready for reporting. The main steps were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Standardized text fields</strong><br>
Cleaned names and citations, removed HTML tags, and ensured consistent capitalization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extracted publication year</strong><br>
Pulled the 4-digit year from the citation field and stored it as a new column.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Removed duplicates at the publication level</strong><br>
Since the raw export repeated each publication once per author, we collapsed these entries so that the dataset represents <em>unique publications</em> rather than author–publication pairs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normalized and split SDG labels</strong><br>
Made SDG names consistent and separated multiple SDGs listed in a single field into individual entries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Created SDG indicator columns</strong><br>
Converted the SDG list into 17 columns (one for each SDG) with values of 1 (present) or 0 (not present).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Corrected split SDGs</strong><br>
Fixed SDGs that were accidentally divided because of internal commas (e.g., “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applied clear SDG labels</strong><br>
Renamed the columns as <code>sdg1_no_poverty</code> through <code>sdg17_partnerships_for_the_goals</code> for clarity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ordered by year</strong><br>
Sorted the dataset by publication year to support timeline analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A snapshot of the cleaned dataset is presented at the end of this section.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="heat-map-of-publications"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Heat Map of Publications</h2>
<p>We begin by filtering the dataset to include only publications from 2016 onward, then calculate the total number of publications per year along with the percentage associated with <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)</a> or with none. We reshape the data into a long format so it can be used in a heatmap, and we create readable labels and percent values for display.</p>
<p>To ensure clarity in the chart, we define an explicit order for the x-axis so that the columns appear as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a total count column, which captures the total number of publications reported in that year,<br>
</li>
<li>a “none” column, which captures the percentage of publications that had no SDGs assigned to them, and then,</li>
<li>SDG1 through SDG17, capturing the percentage of publications which had a specific SDG assigned to them.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that a publication can have more than 1 SDG assigned, hence the summation of the <code>none</code> to the `sdg17’ column can exceed 100% for a given year.</p>
